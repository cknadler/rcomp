# RComp [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/cknadler/rcomp) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/cknadler/rcomp.png)](https://gemnasium.com/cknadler/rcomp)

RComp is a simple way to test command line applications, particularly parsers and compilers.

## Installation

To get started, install rcomp:

```
gem install rcomp
```

## Configuration

RComp stores all configuration in a `.rcomp` file in the root directory of your project. 

Before you start testing, you need to do three things.

Set executable path:

```
rcomp -e path/to/your/executable
```

Set tests directory:

```
rcomp -d tests/rcomp
```

These values are stored in your `.rcomp` file and can be edited manually.

Finally, tell RComp to set up shop in your project directory:

```
rcomp init
```

## Structure

`rcomp init` creates a file structure for your tests within the directory you set with `rcomp -d`.

```
.
|-test
|---expected
|---results
|---tests
```

__tests__: Store your tests here. RComp will be aware of all tests in all subdirectories.

__expected__: Store the expected output of your tests here. These can be generated by RComp with the `gen` command.

__results__: Managed by RComp. Stores the results of running your test against your specified executable.

## Basic Commands

#### `test`:

Run a specific test. If passed a directory, it will run all tests in that directory and all subdirectories.

```
rcomp test hashing.c
```

RComp searches for tests in your tests directory. For example, lets say your tests directory is `rcomp` and you have a test `rcomp/tests/integration/hashing.c`.

You can run that test in the following ways:

`rcomp test integration/hashing.c`

`rcomp test integration/hashing`

`rcomp test hasing.c`

`rcomp test hashing`

#### `test-all`:

Run all tests in your RComp tests directory.

```
rcomp test-all
```

#### `rcomp help`:

Shows you everything RComp has up its sleeve.

```
rcomp help
```
