# Contributing to RComp
* Fork the project.
* Make a topic branch.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, thats fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull.
* Send me a pull request.
